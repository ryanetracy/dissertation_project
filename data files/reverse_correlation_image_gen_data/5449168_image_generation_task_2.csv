,,,,,,,"Bullshit is defined as any statement constructed without regard to the truth. This is in contrast to a lie, which is constructed with the truth as a reference point.

Bullshittees are people who continuously believe bullshit that they hear. While bullshit is frequently encountered in daily life, little is known about how people mentally visualize what a bullshittee looks like. This study was designed to do that.

The following quotes are examples of bullshit. Each of these is designed to sound profound or inspirational but are actually just jumbles of random words in a correct synactical structure without any semantic meaning:

'Synergistic strategies holistically predominate adaptive potentialities.'

'Thriving companies collaboratively utilize parallel fungibility.'

'In the near future, brave pioneers will use crowdsourcing to rapidly transform communities.'

'Soon, engaged change-makers will use virtual reality to efficiently socialize ideas.'

,,,,,,,"Bullshit is defined as any statement constructed without regard to the truth. This is in contrast to a lie, which is constructed with the truth as a reference point.

Bullshitters are people who continuously spread bullshit out into the world. While bullshit is frequently encountered in daily life, little is known about how people mentally visualize what a bullshitter looks like. This study was designed to do that.

The following quotes are examples of bullshit. Each of these is designed to sound profound or inspirational but are actually just jumbles of random words in a correct synactical structure without any semantic meaning:

'In the near future, brave pioneers will use crowdsourcing to rapidly transform communities.'

'Soon, engaged change-makers will use virtual reality to efficiently socialize ideas.'

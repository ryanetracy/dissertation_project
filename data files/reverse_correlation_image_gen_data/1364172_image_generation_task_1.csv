'Synergistic strategies holistically predominate adaptive potentialities.'

'Thriving companies collaboratively utilize parallel fungibility.'

'In the near future, brave pioneers will use crowdsourcing to rapidly transform communities.'

'Soon, engaged change-makers will use virtual reality to efficiently socialize ideas.'
